# Speaker-Verification

This code uses the resemblyzer library to predict who is talking based on the difference in audio files. Record your voice for a few seconds using my VAD code and save the recording as test2.wav. the code then does recognition on ending.wav to determine how similar they are by normalising the audio using various lowpass and highpass filters.

### Run Speaker Verification.py to start the code.
